For several reasons, drinking water throughout the day is a good habit and it's vital for health.

The application is essentially a diary, where the user can register his physical activity and the amount of water he drinks day by day. A tool like a bottle the user can easily carry and with a well known capacity, would be very useful for measuring. Depending on his weight, gender and physical activity, at the beginning of the day he will get a suggested number of bottles to drink. During the day he will put a check for each bottle he will drink. Notifications At the end of the day the effective water intake will be compared with the suggested one. The goal for the user is to get closer and closer to the daily water requirement suggested by the application.
